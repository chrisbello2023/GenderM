# GenderM
OpenCV and cvlib libraries for the task of Gender Detection with machine learning using Python.
In this python project, we implemented a CNN to detect gender and age from a single picture of a face.
The Gender and Age Detection OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, In this Python Project, 
we will use Python Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face.


## OpenCV 
is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library.
This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. 
It supports the Deep Learning frameworks TensorFlow, Caffe, and PyTorch.
